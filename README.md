# Mancala
A program in which two players can play a text-based version of the game Mancala, or in which an optimal Mancala move will be output given a user-inputted starting position.

Gameplay is available in random or normal starting positions, as well as avalanche or normal modes.
Solver allows users to input current board state (thus working for both random and normal mode), and assumes avalanche gameplay. 
Note: Avalanche mode for solver can easily be turned off by changing one keyword (marked with a comment in MancalaSolverv2.java), but it's just more fun playing on avalanche mode.
